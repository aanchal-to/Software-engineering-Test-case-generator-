The techniques for automatic
generation of test cases try to efficiently find a small set of cases that allow an adequacy criterion
to be fulfilled, thus reducing the cost of software testing and resulting in more efficient testing of
software products. Test case generation is the process of building test suites for detecting system
errors. Test case generation is the most important and fundamental process of software testing. In
this co-design method, test cases are used to validate system models and prototypes against the
requirements specification. This ensures coherence between the system models at various levels
of detail, the system prototype. and the final system design. Automating the test case generation
process provides a means to ensure that the test cases have been derived in a consistent and
objective manner and that all system requirements have been covered.
